//How many megabytes are in one gigabyte? 

var megaByte = 1024; //base number for one megabytes
var gigaByte = 1;//showing that just one gigabyte = 1024 megabytes

var gigaByte = 250;//giving a variable to gigaByte for calculation

var totalMegs = megaByte * gigaByte;//calculation 
console.log(totalMegs);//end result which is = 256,000
