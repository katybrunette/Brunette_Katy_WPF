var oneHour = "420 calories";//one hour of pole dancing burns 420 calories
//array = 5 different calorie amounts for 5 days of the week

var calsBurned = [210,840,375,520,420];//array of calorie information
var averageCals = (calsBurned[0] + calsBurned[1] + calsBurned[2] + calsBurned[3] + calsBurned[4]) / 5;//array code that adds all the values together
console.log(averageCals);//prints average number of calories burned to console - correct



var firstName = "Katy"; //this may be added to end of code - first name
var lastName = " Brunette";//last name
var wholeName = firstName + lastName;//this is the calculation of names 
console.log(wholeName);//prints the combined strings to console
